He was born in Nagasaki, Japan; his family moved to England in 1960 when he was five. Ishiguro obtained his bachelor's degree from the University of Kent in 1978 and his Master's from the University of East Anglia's creative writing course in 1980.Yukio Mishima (\u4e09\u5cf6 \u7531\u7d00\u592b , Mishima Yukio ) is the pen name of Kimitake Hiraoka (\u5e73\u5ca1 \u516c\u5a01 , Hiraoka Kimitake , January 14, 1925November 25, 1970) , a Japanese author, poet, playwright, actor, and film director. Mishima is considered one of the most important Japanese authors of the 20th century. He was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968 but the award went to his countryman Yasunari Kawabata. His works include the novels \"Confessions of a Mask\" and \"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\", and the autobiographical essay \"Sun and Steel\". His avant-garde work displayed a blending of modern and traditional aesthetics that broke cultural boundaries, with a focus on sexuality, death, and political change. Mishima was active as a nationalist and founded his own right-wing militia, the Tatenokai. In 1970, he and three other members of his militia staged an attempted \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" when they seized control of a Japanese military base and took the commander hostage, then tried and failed to inspire a coup to restore the Emperor's pre-war powers.
